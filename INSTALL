Installation Instructions
*************************

The preferred way to compile is using the well-known `./configure && make`.  The
generated configure script from Autoconf will run a couple of tests and search
for the right dependencies.  When it finishes successfully, a Makefile is
generated that can be used by Make to compile the source code.

If `./configure` complains about missing necessary dependencies, you need to
install them.  The packages needed for your distribution are listed in the
system package reference of the software's documentation.

If you want to install the compiled library, header files and a few other files
into your system, executing `sudo make install` is all you need to do. Keep in
mind that when you have configured the project with `./configure` and no
arguments, the default prefix is set to `/usr/local`. This is the base directory
under which the compiled and configured files will be installed. By proving
`./configure` with the argument `--prefix=/path`, a different prefix can be
chosen to use when installing.  For example, to install in the same way as
system packages, use `./configure --prefix=/usr`.
